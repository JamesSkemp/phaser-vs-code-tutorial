# Creating a new Phaser Game with Visual Studio Code and TypeScript
This project covers how to create a new Phaser game using Visual Studio Code and TypeScript.

The project will be developed on a Mac, but this should work on a Windows machine with minor modifications.

## Prerequisites
The following are the prerequisites before starting with this project/tutorial.

- [Install and setup Visual Studio Code][vscode]
- [Install Node.js][nodejs]
- [Install TypeScript][typescript]

## Assets used
You can safely substitute any assets you'd like, such as from [OpenGameArt.org][oga], but I'll be using the [Lucky Bestiary - GB - JRPG Monster Pack][lucky-enemies], which is available for purchase from itch.io for a very low cost.
