# Part One: Game Idea
Before actually working with code, let's figure out what sort of game we'd like to build.

A while ago I found the [Lucky Bestiary - GB - JRPG Monster Pack][lucky-enemies], as well as the [Lucky GB GUI Asset Pack][lucky-gui].

Ultimately we may end up using both asset packs, but to start with we'll create a simple game where an enemy will appear, you can click/tap on it to attack it, and it'll disappear once it's been damaged enough, to be replaced by another enemy.

## Next Steps
In [part two](./part-two) of the tutorial we'll create a new project that we'll then use in later parts for our game.
